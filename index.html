      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have never given up the graphical part of me, my friends know that they can count on me when they need help with design and programming even though I hold basic knowledge in them. Due to this I felt that it was about time for me to dive properly and deeply inÂ to programming </p>
